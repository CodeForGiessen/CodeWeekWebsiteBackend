======================

Backend for the europe code week microsite 2014

## Development
This project needs a running MongoDB instance that either runs at `localhost:28017` or a path that is given by the environment variable `MONGO_URI`. The local server port is configurable the same way via the `PORT` environment.

Start the server by running `node .` or `node index`.
